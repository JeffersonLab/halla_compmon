Description of files used for integrating compton DAQ

mainanal_CompMon.cc
    (look here first to see program flow)
    opens input CODA data file and output root file
    loops on events.

Classes:

textParams
  reads a text-based parameter file containing run-number dependent parameters
  will also be used to read CODA readout list parameters dumped into a special
  user's event at start of a CODA file.  Not CompMon-specific
  (Replaced hardwired prameters from comptonParams.cc)

helicityTracker
  deals with helicity status.  Uses the helicityBit input to start predicting
  future helicity states, etc. Not CompMon specific.

comptonStatus
   analyzes auxillary data, helicity bit etc. to determine the status of
   each MPS.  i.e laser state (on/off, left/right)  helicty state (including
   ability to look ahead when running with delayed trigger0.  BeamOn, etc.
   Also where we are in a MPS helicity quad and in a laser cycle.
   Interface to helicityTracker for current helicity state.
   
fadcTriggered
    Handles triggered data with multiple triggers per MPS.
      This includes fadc data pre-summed (pusle data) and waveform samples.
      Includes filling of histograms that show MPS events, triggers, etc.
      sorted by Laser On, Laser Off, helicity,e tc.
      Also processes Mini-Megan Pulser data.

fadcAccums
     Handles accumulator data and other MPS-wise data, including quartet-wise histograms.

fadcdata
     handles unpacking of fadc data.  This Class understands the CODA subbank
     structures used for the integrating compton  (the accumulator banks,
      the triggered summed-pulses, and the waveform samples.)

vmeauxdata
    handles unpacking of auxillary info  from the VME crate, including the scalers.

epcisCompton
    used for EPICS events to pull out the integrating-daq EPICS info.

Standard Hall A stuff
THaCodaData, THaCodaFile, THaEpics
    these Classes understand the basic CODA structure but not the compton-specific
    information.

Structures
  bankstructure.h
     holds info  for a specific CODA subbank  (not compton-specific)
  pulsestructure.h
     holds info for an fadc sampled waveform.
